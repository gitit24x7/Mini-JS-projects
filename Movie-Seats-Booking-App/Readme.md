## Movie Seat Booking

Display movie choices and seats in a theater to select from in order to purchase tickets

## Project Specifications

- Display UI with movie select, screen, seats, legend & seat info
- User can select a movie/price
- User can select/deselect seats
- User can not select occupied seats
- Number of seats and price will update
- Save seats, movie and price to local storage so that UI is still populated on refresh

## Changes I made to the project and the UI: 

- Added a title text to for the not available seats : in the seat type showing banner below pick movie
- Cahnged the cursor for th not available seat types, so it shows that seat is not allowed to be selected
