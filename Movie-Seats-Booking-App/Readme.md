## Project Specifications

- Display UI with movie select, screen, seats, legend & seat info
- User can select a movie/price
- User can select/deselect seats
- User can not select occupied seats
- Number of seats and price will update
- Save seats, movie and price to local storage so that UI is still populated on refresh

## Changes I made to the project and the UI: 

- Added a title text to for the not available seats : in the seat type showing banner below pick movie
- Changed the cursor for th not available seat types, so it shows that seat is not allowed to be selected
- Added a button which animates when clicked for submission 

## Learnings and points to remember
- spread operator can be used to copy object items and array items as well.
- We use the method setItem()(takes a key-value pair and adds it to localStorage) for local storage. 
- Using +e.target.value can change a string to a number without needing to convert it with the methods
