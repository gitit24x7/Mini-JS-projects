# Guess The Number Game


## Algorithm:
- Saver the random number using math.random and use math.round to make it a whole number rather than a fractional value
- Save the user input value and convert it into a number using parseInt
- Check if the user input value is greater than the random number, equal or smaller and show statemets like too high, too low and congrats accordingly
- Empty the input field after every input and display statemens
- 

## Learnings: 
 - There are two way to disable buttons. First by making it disabled in HTML and second via CSS with cursor: not-allowed 
 - Use preventdefault so that the submit event doesnt refresh the page quickly
 - Clearing the form inputs in the text field, we can either input an empty string or use the reset() method. 
 - Form accepts the input if we press enter (this is a default feature of form)
